# FireLESS

FireLESS is a Firebug extension
that makes Firebug display the [LESS](http://lesscss.org)
filenames and line numbers
of LESS-generated CSS styles
rather than those of the generated CSS.

## Special thanks to

This addon is is an adapted fork of
[FireSass](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/103988)
which does the same job for SASS.
